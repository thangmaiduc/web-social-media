## Description

A website similar to facebook, is the first project when using React and Express, MongoDB, I learn a basic process of building a website from scratch. Later on, I continued to develop the project into an internship project.Initially used NoSQL , then switched to SQL to better suit the requirements of teachers.
After working at the company, I have applied some more technologies to the project such as caching, elastic search,... Besides, I want to develop more GraphQL and apply some functionality using RabbitMQ and convert from js to typescript completely.

#### Technologies

- Backend: SocketIO, Express, Redis, Elastic Search, MySQL Server(Sequelize), JWT authentication, Passport.
- Font-end: MaterialUi, React(useHook, redux), CSS
